# EarClippingAlgorithm
Ear Clipping Algorithm implementation based on Python

Algorithm literature: https://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/TriangulationByEarClipping.pdf

How to use:
1. If a geometry exists inside another geometry, the two geometries must be combined using vertices_processing(vertices of A, vertices of B) function first.
2. Use triangulate(vertices of polygon) to do the triangluation
